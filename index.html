		<h1 class="top">Dear book lovers, movie watchers, and media consumers,</h1>
		<h2>Being sick for a week was not an occurrence I anticipated when I came back home for the Fall break. With the time I spent bedridden and having no energy to study for my classes, I turned my attention to different forms of media to keep myself entertained. Generally speaking, I watched movies and television shows, read books (print and digital), and listened to new music that I did not get the chance to explore before. I wrote about those specific shows, movies, books, and music more in depth in the <u><a href="https://cpslo-my.sharepoint.com/:w:/g/personal/athai09_calpoly_edu/EVHoYLjYDCxOoXthHx6oY_0BYjZ7NMwAsCej5y6JtpKrxg?e=QQ9u34" target="_blank">Open Topic writing assignment</a></u>. A common theme that appeared in those media works is romance, love for oneself, others, and more. I became curious about how romance tropes were presented in storytelling because often, when stories are told in similar fashion, they become overused and considered “clichés.” The reader may become disengaged and may not even finish the media work to the end.<br><br>In this collection of genres, I would like to explore which romance tropes are present in certain popular media works and furthermore, what that indicates about society overall. The first piece of this collection is an overall visual of a plethora of common romance tropes and the popular works associated with it. One genre will demonstrate a simple trope with an interesting twist, which is presented as skillful use of a common romance trope without a predictable plot. Another genre will analyze a stance on romance tropes from a reader’s perspective. Please take as much time as needed to explore each piece of text to see how common certain romance tropes are. This collection could potentially be the inspiration or motivation needed to explore a new book, movie, or genre. It is also important to remember that everyone will have different viewpoints on the romance tropes mentioned in this collection. Enjoy!</h2>
