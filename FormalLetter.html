		<h2>
			My belief is that we often consume media regarding romance without considering what trope it takes on. Nowadays, it is a trend to do so, especially on <i>BookTok</i> or <i>Bookstagram</i>, subcommunities of TikTok and Instagram, respectively. Many bookworms recommend books based on a specific trope for others or it is described as such. The same goes for certain movies, but not all. Recent romance movies such as <i>The Kissing Booth</i> (2018) and <i>To All the Boys I’ve Loved Before</i> (2018-2021) have been described with their respective romance tropes (best friend’s brother and fake dating). More recently, <i>Purple Hearts</i> took Netflix’s audience by storm as a combined strangers-to-lovers, enemies-to lovers, fake relationship, marriage-of-convenience love story. What about the more classic romance movies such as <i>The Notebook</i> (2004), <i>Pride and Prejudice</i> (2005) (the book as well), and <i>Titanic</i> (1997)? With time, it has gotten better, but it is still so common for us to read and watch without processing. In this collection of pieces covering the topic of romance, we will analyze:
			<ul>
				<li>Movie and book examples of several sample romance tropes.</li>
				<li><i>The Other Woman</i> as a romance trope that is not overused and cliché.</li>
				<li>Preferred romance tropes by book YouTuber Stephanie Bohrer.</li>
			</ul>
			 Bohrer has an extensive book collection and has read her own fair share of romance books. I must preface that it is completely normal to (dis)agree with her rankings. Not every reader is the same; each reader will enjoy something different. We are watching Bohrer’s video for the reasonings behind her preferences, not opinions. Begin the journey through this portfolio below and enjoy!
